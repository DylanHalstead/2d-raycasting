# Small Demo of 2D Raycasting

I needed to make some code to:
- Create 2D light simulation(s) with accurate calculations
  - Made using the p5.js library
  - Made with Matrix and Vector Manipulation
- Calculate the area of the area casted in light
  - Find the perctage of area casted in light

Made following some fantastic guides and demos of similar projects:
